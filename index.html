The auction will attended by 1000+ members of the community at Fairview, and <span style="font-weight: 700">we at NHS would love your support.</span> Whether you are a local business, a parent, or simply an interested donor, we have plenty of opportunities for you to contribute and plenty of ways for us to <span style="font-weight: 700">provide you publicity in return.</span></p>
      <div class="center">
        <p id="video-right">Foster care centers around Colorado are in urgent need of donated supplies. When children are taken away to foster care, there is often no time for them to pack anything but the clothes they’re wearing on their back. This video, part 1 of a short film called “ReMoved,” gives you a first-hand look into some of the struggles foster children face every day. If this speaks to you, please consider making a donation to help.</p>
