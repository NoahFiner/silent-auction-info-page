  <h1>Silent Auction</h1>
  <p>Fairview High School’s National Honor Society (NHS) is a service organization dedicated to the improvement of our community in Boulder County. On February 8-9, we will be holding a silent auction to support foster care all across Colorado. 100% of the funds raised at the auction will go to foster care in Boulder County, Denver County, and Adams County. The auction will be held during the parent teacher conferences at Fairview High School (an event attended by 800-1000 parents), and we at NHS would love your support. Whether you are a local business, a parent, or simply an interested donor, we have plenty of opportunities for you to contribute and plenty of ways for us to provide you ample publicity in return.</p>

  <h1>For Businesses</h1>
  <p>Interested in contributing back to the Boulder community? Help support our foster kids and attention homes! In return for your (tax-deductible!) generosity, we will display your logo and a blurb about your company on our website and other auction materials. Furthermore, the name of your business will be sent out to 4000 parents in the Fairview community. Please contact nhs@fairviewhs.org for more information!</p>

  <h1>For Parents</h1>
  <p>Interested in winning some awesome items in a silent auction as you wait to talk to teachers? We’ve got you covered! From restaurant vouchers to ski trips to tutoring sessions for your children, we guarantee that you will find something that catches your eye! This year, you can start bidding on our website even before the parent-teacher conferences. Spread the word, make some bids, and good luck!</p>

  <h1>Other</h1>
  <p>Thank you for your interest! Anyone (even outside the Fairview parent community) is free to make bids in our auction. Furthermore, we at NHS are also collecting gently used clothes and school supplies to donate to foster kids. If you have something you can donate, please let us know at nhs@fairviewhs.org with the subject line “Silent auction donation.” </p>
