        <p>Fairview High School’s National Honor Society (NHS) is a service organization dedicated to the improvement of our community in Boulder County. <span style="font-weight: 700">On February 8-9, we will be holding a silent auction to support foster care all across Colorado.</span> 100% of the funds raised at the auction will go to foster care in Boulder County, Denver County, and Adams County. The auction will be held during the parent teacher conferences at Fairview High School (an event attended by 800-1000 parents), and <span style="font-weight: 700">we at NHS would love your support.</span> Whether you are a local business, a parent, or simply an interested donor, we have plenty of opportunities for you to contribute and plenty of ways for us to <span style="font-weight: 700">provide you ample publicity in return.</span></p>
